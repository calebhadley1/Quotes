# Quotes Web Application
Application built to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) quotes through a web interface. Built using a React Frontend, Spring Boot Backend, and MongoDB database. This project's stack was selected with the goal of learning Spring Boot and MongoDB and improving my knowledge of React design patterns.

### Features:
- Register account with encrypted password using BCrypt password encoder
- Confirm account with access token provided on registration

### TODO:
